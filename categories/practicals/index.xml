      <title>JNI Library Name on Mac</title>

      <description>If you try a hello world example for JNI programming, it may tell you that you can just use System.loadLibrary(hello); to load a native library (may be C++, may be C, or some other language). Specifically, on Windows, this &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;hello.dll&amp;rdquo;; on Linux or Unix, it means &amp;ldquo;hello.so&amp;rdquo;. I guess Mac is just one of the Unix members, so I have a shared library compiled and named &amp;ldquo;hello.so&amp;rdquo;.
But I got &amp;ldquo;UnsatisfiedLinkError&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Static Variable Linking Error</title>

      <description>I was working on a side project. It&amp;rsquo;s in C++. Given that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much in C++, I treat it as an opportunity to learn C++ as the project progresses. I was stuck on a problem for several days. Here is the problem. I have a class variable (named cache) but it&amp;rsquo;s static. When compile, it keeps telling me:
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64: &amp;quot;H264_Decoder::cache&amp;quot;, referenced from: H264_Decoder::H264_Decoder(void (*)(AVFrame*, AVPacket*, void*), void*) in H264_Decoder.</description>

      <description>I was working on a short Spring Boot project. However, on my computer, no matter what I tried, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t start and gave me &amp;ldquo;unknown error&amp;rdquo;. The following is the error log:
Wrong Spring Boot output: 4:01:54 PM: Executing external task &#39;bootRun&#39;... :compileJava UP-TO-DATE :processResources UP-TO-DATE :classes UP-TO-DATE :findMainClass :bootRun . ____ _ __ _ _ /\\ / ___&#39;_ __ _ _(_)_ __ __ _ \ \ \ \ ( ( )\___ | &#39;_ | &#39;_| | &#39;_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \ \\/ ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| | ) ) ) ) &#39; |____| .</description>

      <description>ANKI is a software that uses flash cards to help you memorize stuff, such as improving vocabulary for a foreign languge. I have a vocabulary book in .doc format, and I want to convert it into decks of flash cards that Anki can recongnize.
After some massage, I obtained a text file with the following layout:
word definition1 definition2 word definition1 word definition1 definition2 definition3  Anki accepts several plaintext formats, the one I used, is:</description>

      <description>I encountered a problem where I need to put numbers into a set, and later check whether a number is contained in the set. But since we are using Set&amp;lt;Long&amp;gt;, an idea crossed my mind: will 1 equal to 1? &amp;ndash; If I create two Long object holding the same value, are they consider equal by Set?
Yes. Because the hashcode method is implemeted as follows:
return (int)(value ^ (value &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32));  So only the value of that Number object matters, as opposed to the &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; implementation:</description>
